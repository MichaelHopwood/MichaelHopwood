I'm [Michael Hopwood](https://hopml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), PhD student in data science at the **University of Central Florida**. My work experience spans both applied and theoretical data science. In particular, I'm interested in graph neural networks and probabilistic machine learning especially in their applications to physics, but I usually find most things interesting.
